🧏‍♂️ Sign Language Detection using OpenCV and CNN
A real-time Sign Language Alphabet Recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and webcam input. This project interprets American Sign Language (ASL) hand signs and predicts the corresponding alphabet in real time.

📌 Objective
To assist communication between deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and the general population by recognizing static hand gestures representing alphabets using a webcam.

🧠 Key Features
🔤 Detects 26 letters (A–Z) of American Sign Language.

📷 Works live with webcam feed using OpenCV.

🧠 Trained CNN model for gesture classification.

⏱️ Real-time prediction with fast frame processing.

✅ User-friendly interface with overlay text on video stream.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Python	Programming language
OpenCV	Webcam handling, image preprocessing
TensorFlow/Keras	CNN model training and prediction
NumPy	Image matrix operations

🚀 How to Run
🔧 Requirements

pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy
▶️ Train the Model (if needed)

python train_model.py
▶️ Run the Live Detector
python predict.py
Show a hand gesture (A–Z) in front of the camera and it will predict the alphabet.

🧠 Model Details
CNN with convolutional + pooling layers

Dense layer with softmax activation for 26-class output

Trained on labeled ASL dataset

Normalized input images (gray-scaled and resized)

📸 Sample Output
(Add a screenshot or GIF showing live prediction — this really helps.)

🧭 Future Improvements
🔢 Add support for numbers (0–9)

🔡 Build word/sentence recognition using sequence modeling (RNN/LSTM)

🌐 Create a web or Android app for broader accessibility
